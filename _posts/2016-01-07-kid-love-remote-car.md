## Yeah, I made stuff again and again.

There are two things I tried really hard to make when I was a kid. First is a remote control car. And second is a drone. And to be honest, there were nights that I dreamed about one day, I would remote control a car or a drone. Rarely did I know that several years later, I could make those with ease.

And I mean not just buy parts and get the project done. Somehow I wanted to program the car and even the drone. But for this post, I better start with the car.

So the car, in the image, is after I tried with an NRF24 module, and was unable to get it to work, so I temporarily used the door remote control with a reciever to decode the signal. And at least I technically drove for the first time.

## Introduction to the programming world

If I remember correctly, 2015 was the first time I touched the programming world, started with a random book. At that time, I didnâ€™t even know what Arduino was. I just saw it said "programming" and took it home. I never knew it would change my life forever.

Right after reading the book, I saw the potential of programming. And using an online platform (Hshop), I shipped the Arduino board to my hometown, and started to blink the LED for the first time in my life!

For your information, I did make many more projects using only electronic devices, from simple as connecting the battery to the motor in a toy car to running it to ... Putting LED without a resistor into AC, and it blew up (well I'm still alive after all of that).

Thank you to my parents who gave me a lot of... electronic stuff to tear them apart! And another book that I got before the Arduino, which taught me some basic electronic components like capacitors, resistors, and more. It took years until I got my hands on those using online shopping.
