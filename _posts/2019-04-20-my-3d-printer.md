## I have a new competition to join.

After finish my gain iron robotic arm in 2018, inherit from the idea that my examiner won't belive that I actually made the big robotic arm, I make ... well a smaller one, to support that, I build my own 3D printer (for the cheapest price with a huge volume)

So I order parts from a shopee shop (sorted parts and gave... image instruction only) but as least I know english so I can quicly found the origin of the design from thinkverse

In 2023, my 3D printer become the main use for prototyping in a startup, and it got multiple part borken -> PLA degrade after 2 year!
