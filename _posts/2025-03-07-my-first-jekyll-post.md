## Why this blog?

My old website was seriously out of date. It was time to refresh quocanh.net and turn it into a blog.

The old site was something I built ages ago, and it really needed some love. Plus, it was built with Bootstrap, which, while fun at the time, was getting a bit outdated for me. I actually started my professional career during my first year of university, balancing work and study for three years at a startup. It was an intense but incredibly valuable experience.

Recently, I had some free time, so I decided to give the blog a much-needed update. All the posts you see from now on are based on my personal diary entries.

Enjoy!
